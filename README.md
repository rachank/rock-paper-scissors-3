- The site is in black and white to better suit and emphasize the simplicity of the style of the font and images it contains.

- Google Fonts was used to import the font family East Sea Dokdo, which was chosen and used throughout the entire site with Sans Serif as the backup font. East Sea Dokdo compliments the style of the images in its' coarse texture and bold, rough design.

- To increase the enjoyment of the game, some images were designed to use as clickable images for rock, paper, and scissors with some lively facial expressions.

- Start images of rock, paper, and scissors

<img alt="paper start image" src="assets/images/images-start/paper-start.jpg">
